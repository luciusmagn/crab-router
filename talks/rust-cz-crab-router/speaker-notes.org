#+TITLE: Information Theory vs Filters - Speaker Notes
#+AUTHOR: Lukáš Hozda

* Demo Plan

- Run =crab-router= on mainnet
- Watch peer mix in Grafana
- Watch tx flow and relay activity
- Watch =addr= / =getaddr= traffic
- Relate observed behavior back to topology and filtering claims

* Demo Watchlist

- =connected_peers=, =core_peers=, =knots_peers=, =libre_peers=
- =transactions_received= vs =transactions_relayed=
- =transactions_received_from_*=
- =inv_messages_received=
- =addr_messages_received=
- =getaddr_messages_received=

* Demo Fallback

- If live tx traffic is slow, focus on topology and peer classification
- Show discovery traffic and message rates
- Walk through expected relay path from the metrics that are available
- The argument does not depend on a lucky live screenshot
